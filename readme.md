# Fractal Viewer (C++)

Fractal Viewer that I wrote in a little over a day in C++. \
Continuation of my `FractalViewer-cs` repository -- this uses double precision and runs on the CPU

Requires SDL2 to be installed \
Use `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev` or whatever package manager you use to install SDL2 on linux. \
Use `make build` to build the application \
Alternatively `make` (no parameters) builds and runs the application
